This is a basic example of a char device:
This module has a initialized buffer in kernel memory that you
can read from user space.

Usage:
  1) make  --- This generate my_chardevice.ko,  test_writer and test_reader test programs
  2) Insert module into kernel (as root): insmod my_chardevice.ko
     ./inst_module remove previously inserted module, clean dmesg log and re-insert the module
  3) ./test_writer script runs "./writer /dev/my_chardevice"
  4) ./test_reader script runs "./reader /dev/my_chardevice"
